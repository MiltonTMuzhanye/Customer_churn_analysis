# Customer_churn_analysis

This project predict customer churn by building a machine learning model using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue service, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them as customers

## Dataset

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

### 2. Feature Engineering

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 4. Preprocessing Pipeline

### 5. Model Training & Evaluation

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning


## Results

| Model              | Accuracy | ROC AUC | Avg Precision |
|-------------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Gradient Boosting | 0.80     | 0.84    | 0.66           |
| LogisticRegression| 0.74     | 0.84    | 0.63           |
| XGBoost           | 0.76     | 0.82    | 0.63           |
| Random Forest     | 0.78     | 0.82    | 0.61           |

## Conclusion

The Gradient Boosting model achieved the best overall performance in identifying churned customers with the highest ROC AUC and balanced precision recall. This project demonstrates the power of tree based models and feature engineering in solving classification problems
